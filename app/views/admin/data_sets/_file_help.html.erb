<p>The data file can include the following columns. The file must include row headers and each header should be in exactly this format. (eg. "Address 1" is invalid, "address1" is valid). At a minimum we need a postcode to identify the location.</p>
<p><strong>name</strong> | <strong>address1</strong> | <strong>address2</strong> | <strong>town</strong> | <strong>postcode</strong> | <strong>access_notes</strong> | <strong>general_notes</strong> | <strong>url</strong> | <strong>email</strong> | <strong>phone</strong> | <strong>fax</strong> | <strong>text_phone</strong> | <strong>source_address</strong></p>
